{"question": "What is Burp Suite and how is it used?", "context": "Burp Suite is a graphical tool used for web application security testing. It includes components such as a proxy to intercept and modify HTTP/S traffic, a scanner, repeater, intruder, and more. Common usage starts by setting the browser to use Burp as a proxy, then intercepting requests and analyzing or manipulating the responses.", "answer": "Burp Suite is a tool for testing web application security, typically used to intercept and modify HTTP requests and analyze server responses."}
{"question": "What techniques are used in phishing attacks and how can they be mitigated?", "context": "Phishing is a technique where attackers send deceptive emails or messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information or installing malware. Mitigations include user awareness training, email filtering, attachment scanning, and monitoring user reports.", "answer": "Phishing involves sending fake emails to deceive users, and can be mitigated through training, email filtering, and automatic scanning."}
{"question": "How does the Valid Accounts technique work in the MITRE ATT&CK framework?", "context": "Valid Accounts is a technique where adversaries abuse credentials of legitimate accounts to gain access and maintain persistence in a network. Detection methods include monitoring for unusual login activity and multi-factor authentication failures.", "answer": "Valid Accounts is a technique involving the abuse of legitimate credentials for network access, and can be detected through suspicious login patterns."}
{"question": "What is Command and Scripting Interpreter in MITRE ATT&CK?", "context": "Adversaries may use command-line interfaces like PowerShell or bash to execute malicious commands, including downloading payloads or modifying system configurations.", "answer": "Command and Scripting Interpreter refers to executing malicious commands via CLI tools such as bash or PowerShell."}
{"question": "What are the risks of Ingress Tool Transfer in cyber attacks?", "context": "Ingress Tool Transfer involves transferring tools or payloads from external sources into a compromised environment. Common channels include HTTP(S), FTP, or file sharing services. Mitigations include egress filtering and verifying file integrity.", "answer": "Ingress Tool Transfer allows attackers to bring in malicious tools, and should be mitigated with network filtering and file integrity checks."}
{"question": "How can attacks using Remote Services occur and be prevented?", "context": "Remote Services such as RDP and SSH can be abused after credentials are obtained. Prevention measures include firewalls, segmentation, VPN usage, and multi-factor authentication.", "answer": "Remote service attacks occur through credential abuse, and can be prevented using MFA, firewalls, and network segmentation."}
